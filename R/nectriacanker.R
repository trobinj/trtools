#' Fixed area sample of tree diameter and abundance of nectria cankers.
#'
#' These data are from a sample of fixed area plots, each of area 0.01ha
#' from a 10ha tract of land. Tree diameter and the number of cankers were
#' observed for each tree in each plot.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 38 observations and three variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{plot}{fixed area plot number}
#'    \item{dbh}{tree diameter at breast height in cm}
#'    \item{cankers}{number of observed cankers on tree}
#' }
#'
#' @note Gregoire and Valentine (2007) assume that no plots overlap and that no plots overlap
#' the boundary of the tract.
