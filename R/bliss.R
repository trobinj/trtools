#' Mortality of confused flour beetles from carbon disulphide. 
#'
#' Data from an experiment investigating the effect of gaseous carbon disulphide on the mortality of confused flour beetles (\emph{Tribolium confusum}). Cloth cages of batches of approximately thirty beetles were suspended in a flask above a fixed volume of liquid carbon disulphide. The number of dead beetles after five hours of exposure was recorded. 
#'
#' @format A data frame with 16 observations and three variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{concentration:}{concentration of gaseous carbon disulphide (mg/l)}
#'    \item{dead:}{number of dead beetles after five hours of exposure}
#'    \item{exposed:}{number of beetles exposed}
#' }
#'
#' @note These data are frequently featured in textbooks and R packages, but usually the two replicates for each concentration are aggregated. The data as shown here were featured in Bliss (1935) but are originally from Strand (1930).
