#' Effect of radiation on jejunal crypts in rats. 
#'
#' Data from an experiment where mice were exposed to a single dose of radiation. The mice were then sacrificed and the number of surviving jejunal crypts (intestinal glands in the small intestine) were counted.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 126 observations on two variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{dose:}{dose of radiation in Gy (gray)}
#'    \item{crypts:}{number of surviving jejunal crypts}
