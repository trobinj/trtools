#' Loss of ascorbic acid in frozen snap beans. 
#'
#' Data from a study of the loss of ascorbic acid in frozen snap beans as a function of storage temperature and time. The design is a completely randomized factorial design with three replications at each of three temperatures and four weeks of storage. The observations of ascorbic acid are the total ascorbic acid for the three replications within each condition.

#' @format A data frame 12 observations and three variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{acid:}{total ascorbic acid (mg per 100g)}
#'    \item{weeks:}{weeks of storage}
#'    \item{temp:}{storage temperature (F)}
