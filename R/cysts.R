#' Settling time of amoebic cysts in water.
#'
#' Data from an experiment on the settling time of amoebic cysts in water for the purpose of water purification. Observations were made of settling time at three different temperatures. The diameter of the cysts was also recorded. Note that each observation is an average of several observations.

#' @format A data frame with 21 observations and four variables.
