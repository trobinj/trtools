#' Lifespan of humans and dogs.
#'
#' Hypothetical data of the lifespan of humans and dogs for illustrating accelerated failure time models. The lifespan of humans is about seven times that of dogs.
#'
#' @format A data frame 500 observations and two variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{years:}{lifespan in year (i.e., years from birth to death)}
#'    \item{species:}{species (dog or human)}
#' }
#'
#' @note Some of the extreme survival times are obviously not realistic.
