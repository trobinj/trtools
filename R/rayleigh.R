#' Lord Rayleigh's measurements of nitrogen gas.
#' 
#' Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) conducted several experiments in which he tried to isolate samples of nitrogen gas at fixed volumes, temperature, and pressure by removing oxygen from dry air or through the decomposition of nitrogen compounds.

#' \describe{
#'    \item{mass:}{mass of gas sample in grams}
#'    \item{method:}{method of isolating the nitrogen gas}
#' }
#' 
#' @note The difference in the mass of nitrogen isolated from atmospheric air (using the "hot iron" or "ferrous hydrate" methods) with nitrogen obtained from chemical decompositions (i.e., from nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, or ammonium nitrate) is assumed to be due to the presence of other elements or compounds in the atmospheric air, namely argon.
