#' Chromosome aberrations in survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
#'
#' Study of the number of aberrations in a sample of 100 cells in survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  
#'
#' @format A data frame 1052 observations and three variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{cells:}{number of cells (out of 100) exhibiting chromosome aberrations}
#'    \item{radiation:}{approximate dose of radiation (in rads) }
#'    \item{city:}{city of residence}
#' }
#'
#' @note The data are from Otake and Prentice (1984). The 400-999 and 1000+ rad groups have been combined here as both are quite sparse.
