#' Survey of leaf surface area.
#'
#' A simple random sample of 20 leaves from a population of 744 leaves of "shining gum" (\emph{Eucalyptus nitens}). The area of all 744 leaves was approximated by computing length times width, with a total area of 57266.6 cubic cm. The leaf surface area was accurately measured for only this sample of 20 leaves.
