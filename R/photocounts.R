#' Counts of dead trees using aerial photographs and field counts in a 80ha parcel of land divided into 80 units. Field counts are more costly but also more accurate than those based on aerial photographs. 
#'
#' @format A data frame with 80 observations and two variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{photo}{count of dead trees from aerial photograph}
#'    \item{field}{count of dead trees from the field}
#' }
