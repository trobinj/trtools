#' Data from an experiment of the effect of salinity and temperature on hatching of sole.
#'
#' Tanks of eggs of English sole (\emph{Parophrys vetulus}) were exposed to different levels of salinity and temperature. The number of eggs in each tank that hatched was counted. 
#'
#' @format A data frame 72 observations on four variables.
#' \describe{
#'    \item{salinity:}{water salinity in g/kg}
#'    \item{temp:}{water temperature in degrees Celsius}
#'    \item{hatched:}{number of eggs that hatched}
#'    \item{total:}{number of eggs in tank}
