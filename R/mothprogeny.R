#' Sex ratios in moth progeny.
#'
#' Data from a study of the progeny of light-brown apple moths (\emph{Epiphyas postvittana}) in four localities in Australia. Each observation is the progeny of a single adult female moth. 
#'
#' @format A data frame 60 observations and three variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{male:}{number of male offspring}
#'    \item{female:}{number of female offspring}
#'    \item{locality:}{location the moth/progeny was sampled}
#' }
#'
#' @note The appearance of several progeny with few or no male offspring is thought to be due to a particular genetic condition, so that the sex ratios may be due to a finite or continuous mixture. See Lewis (1987) for details about the study and some statistical issues.
