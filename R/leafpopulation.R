#' Weight and area of all the leaves from a sapling. 
#'
#' @format A data frame with 64 observations and two variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{weight:}{leaf weight (grams)}
#'    \item{area:}{leaf area (square cm)}
#' }
#'
#' @note Data from Gregoire and Valentine (2007). These data can be used as a population to demonstrate calibration. Of particular note is the somewhat nonlinear relationship between weight and area.
