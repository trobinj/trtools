#' Survey of radon concentration in homes in Blue Ridge, VA.
#'
#' Data from a simple random survey of homes in Blue Ridge, VA, from a population of 13,895 homes. The radon
#' concentration was measured in the ground floor of each home. It was also observed whether or not the home
#' had a basement with concrete walls.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 140 observations and two variables:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{radon}{ground floor radon concentration in pCi/L}
#'    \item{basement}{does the house have a basement?}
#' }
#'
#' @note These data were obtained using a simple random sampling design, not stratified random sampling. But
#' the basement variable could be used for post-stratification.
