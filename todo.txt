add ability to conduct joint tests in contrast and lincon

change contrast, lincon, dmethod covariance argument from function to matrix?

modify lincon and dmethod for simultaneous inference using mvtnorm

Add transform option to margeff?

Add option to lincon to not have row label(s). 

Include glm family (link and variance function) for a quasi-likelihood type model with an expected response bounded to [0,c] for any c > 0. This would be sort of like the Wedderburn quasi-likelihood models.
