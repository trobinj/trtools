# trtools

This is a R package, mostly of data sets but also a few utility functions, for use in teaching statistics --- mainly regression and survey sampling. It can be installed using the command
```R
devtools::install_github("trobinj/trtools", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
within R, assuming you have the `devtools` package installed. The option `build_vignettes = TRUE` is necessary to build the vignettes included with the package.
